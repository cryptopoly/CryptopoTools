# CryptopoTools

"I command you to have a bash with the python on your desktop" <br />
Satoshi Swagamoto aka CryptoRaptor


# Summary <br />
This suppository contains some nifty tools for developing and testing scripts written ".py", ".command", ".sh" and ".desktop". Great for continuous running and re-running of scripts. Saves a bundle of time doing stuff.


# Command_Launcher.sh <br />
Basic Command Launcher for building an executable menu of command files within a specific folder.


# Python_Shell_Command_Launcher_Suite.sh <br />
More advanced Launcher Suite building an executable menu of shell, command, python and desktop files within a specific folder.



# Rules
1. You'll probably need to enable/trust the files to execute via double-click - if so go to terminal and run <br />
'-chmod +x *.sh'

2. Open Command_Launcher in text edit and update working directory to that where the .sh files are stored <br />
-e.g. $HOME/CryptopoTools.

3. This only works with filenames without spaces - apparently that's the in thing with devs - so remove spaces from your files until I figure everything out. <br />

4. Relax and enjoy your new & improved development and testing experience! <br />
