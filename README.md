Bash Tools

I command you to have a bash with the python on your desktop - launchpad edition!


Rules.

1. You'll probably need to enable/trust the files to execute via double-click... if so go to terminal and run
-chmod +x *.sh

2. Open Command_Launcher in text edit and update working directory to that where the .sh files are stored
-e.g. /asset-mapping/macos-scripts

3. Relax and enjoy your new & improved development and testing experience!
